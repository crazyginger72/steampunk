In other words...all the artwork in this pack is my own work, with exceptions. Listed below are textures used in lieu of my own and all freely donated to my texture pack - all license and permissions for me to use such artwork is to be found in my thread on 'minecraftforums.net' (under 'Texture Packs') If you wish to use any artwork within this Texture Pack, not created by The Owner, you must first seek permission of it's creator, even if the artwork is a simple edit of The Owner's work. Otherwise it is assumed you need the Owner's permission. See my thread on 'minecraftforums.net' (Texture Packs).
